\section{Purpose}
The goal of this lab is to learn to collect data with an ADC and other sensors.

\section{Procedure}
\subsection{Main Requirements}
Write a sketch with the following functionality:

Collect the following data and display it once every 5 seconds via serial and on the display with the 
appropriate labels and units if you can make them fit.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The output from \lstinline@millis()@ (ms)
	\item Both light intensities as a number between 0 and 1023 (unitless)
	\item Potentiometer value as a voltage between 0 and 3.3~V
	\item Temperature in Fahrenheit from TEMP0 (U27 attached to input 0 of U37)
    \item Get 1-Wire (DS18B20) sensors reporting temperatures via Serial
    \item Display 1-Wire temperatures on display
    \item Get SHT31 reporting temperature and humidity via Serial
    \item Add SHT31 data to display 
    \item Get compass (QMC5883L) reporting azimuth via Serial
    \item Add azimuth data to the display
    \item Get IMU (LSM6DSOX) reporting accelerations and gyroscope data via Serial 
    \item Add accelerometer and gyroscope data to display
\end{enumerate}

The light sensors, potentiometer, and temperature sensor are connected to ADS7142 
analog-to-digital (ADC) sensors. There is a library in the normal library adding 
method. Look for the library for the ADS7142 by Seth McNeill. After you install it,
there should now be examples under Anitracks ADS7142. Follow the read2Ch example 
combined with your previous work to complete this lab.

\subsection{Suggestions}
Use a \href{https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/stringobject/}{String} 
object to accumulate your display string and then call \lstinline@display.println(yourString)@ 
to display it. Note a few things:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The String type starts with a capital S.
	\item You can add to the String object using \lstinline@+=@ or just \lstinline@+@, 
		but with only the plus operator, all arguments have to be of the same type. 
	\item The String object also allows you to limit the number of decimal places for \lstinline@float@ types.
            \lstinline@String(tF,1)@ displays tF to 1 decimal place.
\end{enumerate}
An example is shown in Listing \ref{lst:dispstr}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={This is an example of using a String 
		object to display text and float variables. The floats are 
		limited to 1 decimal place such that 7.123 would be displayed as 7.1.},
		label={lst:dispstr},language=C++]
	String dispStr;
	dispStr = "T(F): ";
	dispStr += String(tF,1);
	dispStr += "\n";
	// Control the display  
	tft.fillScreen(ST77XX_BLACK);  // clear display
	tft.setTextColor(ST77XX_YELLOW);  // set text color
	tft.setTextSize(1);  // Normal 1:1 pixel scale
	tft.setCursor(0,0);  // Start at top-left corner
	tft.println(dispStr);
\end{lstlisting}
However, if you want to have different portions of the text in different colors you will
need to call \lstinline@tft.setTextColor@ between each \lstinline@tft.println@.

\subsection{1-Wire Sensors}
As mentioned in class, the only library I have found to work with the Nano Connect 
RP2040 is the \href{https://github.com/pstolarz/OneWireNg}{OneWireNg} library. 
Unfortunately, the library examples are very complex. There is a simpler solution by 
combining the examples from the OneWire library with the capabilities of the OneWireNg 
library. It has to be done carefully though. Here is how to do it:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the Arduino IDE install both the OneWire and OneWireNg libraries
    \item Open the OneWire example named \lstinline@DS18x20_Temperature@ 
    \item Add this line above the \lstinline@#include <OneWire.h>@ line:\\
            \lstinline@#include "OneWireNg_CurrentPlatform.h"@ 
    \item This example should now compile and run just fine 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{NOTE}
This example reads the results from one (1) sensor per pass through the 
\lstinline@loop()@ function. For your program, you will want to collect 
all three sensors' data in a single pass through the \lstinline@loop()@ 
function.

\subsection{SHT31 Temperature and Humidity Sensor}
Use Adafruit's SHT31 library. Base your code on their example. Be sure 
to make sure that the heater is off. For this class, you do not need to 
turn on the heater.

Also, the SHT31 needs to be reset each time the program starts. It's 
reset pin is connected to a PCA9535. Don't forget to use the 
\href{https://github.com/semcneil/PCA95x5}{PCA95x5 library written by Seth McNeill}, 
not the one in the Arduino library manager. An example of how to do this
is shown in Listing \ref{lst:sht31reset}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={This listing shows how to reset the SHT31.},
label={lst:sht31reset},language=C++]
Wire.begin();
muxU31.attach(Wire, 0x20);
muxU31.polarity(PCA95x5::Polarity::ORIGINAL_ALL);
muxU31.direction(0x1CFF);  // 1 is input, see schematic to get upper and lower bytes
muxU31.write(PCA95x5::Port::P08, PCA95x5::Level::L);  // disable SHT31
delay(100);
muxU31.write(PCA95x5::Port::P08, PCA95x5::Level::H);  // enable SHT31
delay(100);

Serial.println("SHT31 test");
if (! sht31.begin(0x44)) {   // Set to 0x45 for alternate i2c addr
    Serial.println("Couldn't find SHT31");
    while (1) delay(1);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{QMC5883L Compass}
Use the library by MRPrograms for the QMC5883L compass. The azimuth example 
should provide what you need to make it go.

\subsection{LSM6DSOX IMU}
Install the Arduino library for the LSM6DSOX IMU. Your program will need 
to use a combination of the SimpleAccelerometer and SimpleGyroscope examples.
NOTE: This library returns acceleration in g's not $m/s^2$.

\section{Main Requirements}
Write a sketch with the following functionality:

Collect the following data and display it once every 5 seconds via serial and on 
the display with the appropriate labels and units if you can make them fit.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The output from \lstinline@millis()@ (ms)
	\item Both light intensities as a number between 0 and 1023 (unitless)
	\item Potentiometer value as a voltage between 0 and 3.3~V
	\item Temperature in Fahrenheit from TEMP0 (U27 attached to input 0 of U37)
 	\item The temperatures from all 3 1-Wire DS18B20 sensors (takes ~3 seconds for acquisition)
	\item The temperature and humidity from the SHT31 sensor
	\item The compass azimuth angle
	\item The 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data (6 data points)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Turn In}
Turn in the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Have either the TA or the instructor sign-off on your lab
    \item A PDF of your sketch.
    \item .ino versions of your sketch.
    \item Fill out the end of lab quiz prior to leaving. Note that it includes asking you 
            for the output of the \lstinline$getIDs$ sketch. 
\end{enumerate}
