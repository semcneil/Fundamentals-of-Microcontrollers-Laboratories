\chapter{Multiplexer, LED Display, Binary, HEX}
\chaplabel{muxled}

\section{Purpose}
The goal of this lab is to use binary and hexadecimal numbers in an applied setting. This is 
achieved by having you (the student) use the Arduino Nano Connect RP2040 to setup the 
PCA9535 I$^2$C Input/Output (IO) port chip to drive a 4-digit LED display.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Procedure}
\subsection{Add PCA95x5 library}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the Arduino IDE 
    \item Open preferences
    \item Note the Sketchbook location 
    \item Go to the website for the PCA9535 library (see \ref{sec:resources} Resources section)
    \item Click the green Code button and then Download ZIP
    \item Save the zip file to your Downloads folder or somewhere else you can find it again
    \item In the Arduino IDE select Sketch $\rightarrow$ Include Library $\rightarrow$ Add .ZIP Library
    \item Select the zip file you downloaded earlier
    \item Wait for the IDE to say "Library added to your libraries"
    \item Check that the library is indeed installed one of two ways:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Go to Sketch $\rightarrow$ Include Libraries and look for PCA95x5
        \item Go to File $\rightarrow$ Examples and look for the PCA95x5 examples
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The PCA95x5 library is now added successfully.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Turn on some LEDs}
An example script is shown in Listing \ref{lst:leddispstart}. Use this as a starting point for your
code. Be sure to change the header information to include all lab partner names and the correct 
date. This script displays an 8. in the first digit and zeros in the rest. Note the clearing
lines to make it so that there is not ghosting of numbers to the right of where they are displayed.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run the script in Listing \ref{lst:leddispstart} to make sure it runs
    \item Change the script so that it displays four consecutive numbers such as 1234. You can use
            any 4 consecutive, single digit numbers.
    \item Demonstrate your sketch working to a TA or instructor.
\end{enumerate}

   #include <PCA95x5.h>  // include library
   
   PCA9535 LEDmux;  // create instance (object) of library
   
   void setup() {
     Serial.begin(115200);
     while(!Serial);
     Serial.println("Starting...");

     Wire.begin();

     LEDmux.polarity(PCA95x5::Polarity::ORIGINAL_ALL);
     uint16_t mux_direction = 0;
     mux_direction = 0x0010;  // mostly outputs
     LEDmux.direction(mux_direction);
   
     Serial.println("Everything setup");
   }
   
   
   void loop() {
     int delayTime = 0;
     // use object
     LEDmux.write(0x000F);  // required to remove ghosting on other digits
     LEDmux.write(0xFF0E);
     delay(delayTime); 
     LEDmux.write(0x000F);  // required to remove ghosting on other digits
     LEDmux.write(0x3F0D);
     delay(delayTime); 
     LEDmux.write(0x000F);  // required to remove ghosting on other digits
     LEDmux.write(0x3F0B);
     delay(delayTime); 
     LEDmux.write(0x000F);  // required to remove ghosting on other digits
     LEDmux.write(0x3F07);
     delay(delayTime); 
   }
\end{lstlisting}
    
\subsection{Count}
Make a new sketch, based off your first sketch (meaning copy and paste it into the new sketch).
This new sketch should count up from 0 to 9 (or 0000 to 0009) incrementing once per second. 

\subsection{Extra credit}
Have your counting system count higher than 9.

\section{Turn In}
Turn in the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A video of your board counting that includes both of your faces and you saying your names.
    \item A PDF of your first sketch that displays 4 consecutive numbers.
    \item A PDF of your second sketch that counts.
    \item .ino versions of both sketches.
\end{enumerate}
