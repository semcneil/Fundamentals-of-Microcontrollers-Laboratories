# Fundamentals of Microcontrollers Laboratory Manual
This repository contains the laboratory manual to accompany the [Fundamentals of Microcontrollers class manual](https://github.com/semcneil/Fundamentals-of-Microcontrollers-Manual). A PDF of the manual [is available](https://semcneil.github.io/Fundamentals-of-Microcontrollers-Laboratories/Fundamentals-of-Microcontrollers-Lab.pdf). I would recommend checking back often as the manual is continually evolving. If you find any errors/problems, please [open an issue about them](https://github.com/semcneil/Fundamentals-of-Microcontrollers-Laboratories/issues/new).

The basic layout of the project was inspired by Pat Morin's [Open Data Structures](https://github.com/patmorin/ods) book.

## Assembling the manual
If everything is setup correctly, running `make` in the main directory should generate
`manual.pdf` in the `latex` directory.
